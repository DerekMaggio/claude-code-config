# Named Build Tagging Skill Configuration
#
# This file contains environment variables for the named-build-tagging skill.
#
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file and rename it to: .env
# 2. Update the DEFAULT_CONFIGURATION_FILE_PATH below with your actual config file path
# 3. The .env file is gitignored and will not be committed to version control
#
# DEFAULT_CONFIGURATION_FILE_PATH:
#   - Purpose: Specifies the absolute path to your JSON configuration file containing
#             the list of repositories to tag
#   - Format: Absolute file path (e.g., /home/username/path/to/config.json)
#   - Default: Can be any path, but typically stored outside this skill directory
#   - Example: /home/derek-maggio/workspace/named-build-tagging-config.json
#
# If this .env file doesn't exist when the skill runs, you'll be prompted to either:
# - Provide the path to an existing configuration file
# - Create a new example configuration file to get started

DEFAULT_CONFIGURATION_FILE_PATH=/path/to/your/named-build-tagging-config.json
